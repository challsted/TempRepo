## Step 1 - FORK ME! FORK ME HARDER!

1. Fork this Repo!
2. Click the "Fork" button above:  
 * ![Stolen from Linode's Git for Begginers][GHFork]
3. This will launch a cool GIF of a book being coppied
4. It will then bring you to this repo but in YOUR GitHub!

## Step 2 - CLONE MY BABY!

1. Clone this repo to your local machine:  
 * ![Stolen from Linode's Git for Begginers][GHClone]
2. Open a terminal on your local machien and enter this:  
 *  `git clone git@github.com:<GitHubUsername>/TempRepo.git`
3. This will clone the repo into your local!

## Step 3 - EDIT MY SOURCE CODE TOO!

1. cd into the newly created folder and openup the README file
 * `cd TempRepo && vim README.md`
2. You should be looking at this line now, but in VIM!
3. Add something to the bottom of this document, a comment, a snipit of code, a message to the world I dont care, just make sure you add your name! Please dont edit the origional instructions (unless its a spelling mistake, then fix it you  Nazi [even though if you follow history you will know this as the Gshstapo]...)  
 * G (Shift-G) takes you to the end of the document  
 * i (lower case i) puts you into insert mode (you can type and your characters are literal now)  
 * Esc (Escape Key, usually top left of the keyboard) will put you back into command mode  
 * :wq (Shift-; then w, then q, then enter key) this will save your document and quit  
 * Contratz! You just edited a document in VIM!  

## Step 4 - PUSH ME BACK UP!

1. Git Add, Git Commit, Git Push  
   ```
   git add README.md  

   git commit -m "Pushing back up for Step 4.1" # Or another optional message, idk  

   git push origin master                       # If you have an issue here, see the subnote  

   ```
 * You might need to setup SSH Keys, heres the official guide on how -> [Guide][GHGuide]

## Step 5 - Pull my Request?

 * ![Found from Google Search][GHPullReq]
3. Click big "New Pull Request" Button
4. Click "Create pull request" icon"
 * Give it a title (idk what, something about pull request)
